# QualtricsSDK+SwiftUI
This is a sample application with examples of SwiftUI workarounds for [Qualtrics iOS SDK](https://api.qualtrics.com/2241421657525-getting-started-with-the-mobile-app-sdk-on-i-os).
This application can also be used for debugging. Please see the [runbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EyHYw7hAmaZzcnmlCWXtsTEKLOKLDKGurW0eZkVKkSw/edit) on how to set it up, and use for debugging.


## Contributing
**This version of the app is internal** - due to that reason **there is a `Team` and a `BundleID` assigned in the ProjectFile**. This allows our teams to run the App as-is. **If you're planning on making changes you - later - want to push to the public version of this App, then please make sure to manually retract that information. We do not want to push our _Qualtrics Team Id_ or _BundleID_ to the public repo.**

In order to contribute, please:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a separate branch, and push your suggestions there. 
3. Create a Merge Request to the `main` branch.
4. Request Review on [this Slack Channel](https://qualtrics.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C067SLN71A6) from one of members of DF Mobile Team.
5. Once approved - one of the members will merge the changes.
